I enjoy playing video games! My favorite video game series is *[Animal Crossing](https://www.animal-crossing.com/new-horizons/)*!

I've been playing it with my siblings for a **very long** time now. 

You can do all sorts of things, like:
- Go fishing
- Catch bugs
- Dig up fossils
- and much more!

Here's another block of code from one of my projects in INFOTC 1040. It calculates a moving objects position:
```
#get values from user
initial_pos = float(input("What is the object's initial position (in m)? "))
initial_vel = float(input("What is the object's initial velocity (in m/s)? "))
acceleration = float(input("What is the object's acceleration (in m/s squared)? "))
time = float(input("For how long is the object traveling (in s)? "))

#calculate final position
final_pos = initial_pos + initial_vel * time + 0.5 * acceleration * time * time

#convert final position from float to string
final_pos = str(final_pos)

#print final position
print("The object's final position (in m) is " + final_pos + ".")
```
