# INFOTC 1000 Final Project
## Page 1

This is the **first page** of my final project! It will show some random things about me!

![my family and me](familypic.jpg)

- My *favorite* tech company is [Apple](https://www.apple.com/)!
- I'm in INFOTC 1040 as well!
- I like food, technology, and music!
- I listen to music on [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/)

The first block of code I wrote for INFOTC 1040 was:
```
print('My name is Jacob McIntosh.')
print("I'm from Hamilton, MO.")
print('I love technology!')
print("I'm excited for what's to come in this class and beyond!")
```
And I've come a **long** way since then!
